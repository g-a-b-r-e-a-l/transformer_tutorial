# transformer_tutorial
This is a transformer model I got working with simulated data. Here I tried to rebuild structure of each module from memory as an exercise to understand transformer models better. Then I changed model parameters such as vocabulary size, attention heads and model dimension. The source code for this transformer was taken from https://medium.com/data-science/build-your-own-transformer-from-scratch-using-pytorch-84c850470dcb
